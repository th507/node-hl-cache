# HLCache (Half-life cache)
This is a variant of Clock cache algorithm that keeps a ghost copy for an extended period of time. It could be useful for implementing shared session cache.

# Install
```bash
$ npm install hl-cache
```

# API
* `new HLCache([options])`
	Create a cache pool.

```js
var cache = new HLCache({
	 // maximum size of the cache
	max: 2000,
	 // cache entry time-to-live in milliseconds
	lifespan: 2000
});
```

If the number of items in the cache pool exceeds `max`, the item will not be store in the cache.

- `HLCache::get(key[, timestamp])`

Get the value by `key`. `timestamp` is optional, it is used to indicate the time the visit comes from. If no value is provided, `timestamp` is set to `Date.now()`.

- `HLCache::set(key, value[, timestamp])`

Set the value of `key` to `value`. `timestamp` is optional, it is used to indicate the time the visit comes from. If no value is provided, `timestamp` is set to `Date.now()`.

- `HLCache::has(key)`

Check if a key is in the cache.

- `length`

Return total length of objects in cache.

# Running on Node.js <= 0.10.x
This package use `Map` and [es6-map](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-map) to polyfill `Map` on old version of Node.

es6-map is install as [`optionalDependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#optionaldependencies). The dependencies section of your application's `package.json` file must contain es6-map in order for the polyfill to work.

# Test

```bash
$ npm test
```


# Half-life cache algorithm
![Half-life cache algorithm is a variant of clock cache algorithm that keeps a ghost copy for an extended period of time.](https://github.com/th507/node-hl-cache/raw/master/hl-cache.png)

Half-life cache could (almost) guarantees consistent read in cacheâ€™s lifespan, which could be useful for implementing shared session cache.
